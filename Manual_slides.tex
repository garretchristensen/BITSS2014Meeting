% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}
 \begin{frame}
 Our goal:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
 Detailed hands-on how-to manual, linking to the best examples.
 \item 
 Cover all aspects of a transparent research project, from beginning (hypothesis registration) to end (publication, data sharing).
 \item 
 Keep the manual updated.
 \item
 Encourage participation from the community.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Ethical Research}
\begin{frame}{Ethical Research}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Transparency is part of being an ethical researcher. 
\item
Admit that we're human, subject to bias and motivated reasoning, transparency can help with this (Nosek, Spies, Motyl 2012).
\item
Since a lot of us run experiments, we should take IRBs seriously as part of transparency (Ch. 11--13 Morton \& Williams 2010, Desposato 2014). 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Study Design and Power}
\begin{frame}{Study Design and Power--BETA}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Adequately power trials to help prevent spurious significant results. 
\item
Practical suggestions like collaboration with other labs to mutually run each others' experiments (Open Science Collaboration 2014).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Registrations}

\subsection*{Publication Bias}
\begin{frame}{Publication Bias}%{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.
  The problem:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
 Effect sizes diminish with sample size (Gerber, Green, Nickerson 2001)
  \item
  There is a higher fraction of rejected hypothesis tests in the social sciences (Fanelli 2010).
  \item
  	Published null results are disappearing over time, in all disciplines (Fanelli 2011). 
  \item
  	Data on the complete set of experiments run shows strong results are 40pp more likely to be published, and 60pp more likely to be written up. The file drawer problem is large. (Franco, Malhotra, Simonovits 2014)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin {frame}{Publication Bias}
If we only write up/publish significant results, and we have no record of all the insignificant results, we have no way to tell if our `significant' results are real, or if they're the 5\% we should expect due to noise.
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Registrations}
\begin{frame}{Registrations}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item
   Publicly stating all research you will do, what hypotheses you will test, prospectively.
   %\item If we know every hypothesis test that is run on a given subject, we have a better idea of how seriously to take the significant results.
  \item
   Near universal adoption in medical RCTs. Numerous journals won't publish if it's not registered. \url{http://clinicaltrials.gov}
  \item
   Even better if registry requires outcomes from after study. Currently limited, but NIH is moving on this.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Registrations}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Newer to social sciences, but:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item
   	AEA registry, currently only for RCTs. \url{http://socialscienceregistry.org}
   \item
    EGAP registry \url{http://egap.org/design-registration}
   \item 
    3ie registry, for developing country evaluations. \url{http://ridie.3ieimpact.org}
   \item
   	Open Science Framework \url{http://osf.io}
   	\begin{itemize}
   	\item
   	Open format
   	\item
   	Will soon sync with above
   	\end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

\section{Pre-Analysis Plans}
\subsection*{P-Hacking}
\begin{frame}{P-Hacking}
The problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Also called fishing, researcher degrees of freedom, or data-mining.
\item
Definition: flexibility in data analysis allows portrayal of \textit{anything} as below an arbitrary p-value threshhold; significance loses its meaning.
\item
Not something only evil people do. It's subconcious, or simply built into statistics (Gelman, Loken 2013).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\begin{frame}{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item
Often part of a registration
\item
From 3ie: ``A pre-analysis plan is a detailed description of the analysis to be conducted that is written in advance of seeing the data on impacts of the program being evaluated. It may specify hypotheses to be tested, variable construction, equations to be estimated, controls to be used, and other aspects of the analysis. A key function of the pre-analysis plan is to increase transparency in the research. By setting out the details in advance of what will be done and before knowing the results, the plan guards against data mining and specification searching. Researchers are encouraged to develop and upload such a plan with their study registration, but it is not required for registration.''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Glennerster, Takavarasha Suggestions}
\textit{Running Randomized Evaluations}

\item
  the main outcome measures,
\item
  which outcome measures are primary and which are secondary,
\item
  the precise composition of any families that will be used for mean
  effects analysis,
\item
  the subgroups that will be analyzed,
\item
  the direction of expected impact if we want to use a one-sided test,
  and
\item
  the primary specification to be used for the analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Description of the sample to be used in the study
\item
  Key data sources
\item
  Hypotheses to be tested throughout the causal chain
\item
  Specify how variables will be constructed
\item
  Specify the treatment effect equation to be estimated
\item
  What is the plan for how to deal with multiple outcomes and multiple
  hypothesis testing?
\item
  Procedures to be used for addressing survey attrition
\item
  How will the study deal with outcomes with limited variation?
\item
  If you are going to be testing a model, include the model
\item
  Remember to archive it
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simmons, Nelson, Simonsohn (2011)}
\begin{enumerate}[<.->]
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection before
  data collection begins and report this rule in the article.
\item
  Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide
  a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification.
\item
  Authors must list all variables collected in a study.
\item
  Authors must report all experimental conditions, including failed
  manipulations.
\item
  If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the
  statistical results are if those observations are included.
\item
  If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the
  statistical results of the analysis without the covariate.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples}
Wide range of when to write and how detailed to make the plan. At the extreme level of detail you would have your entire code already written before you got any data.

\item
AEA Registry has relatively few, plentiful in EGAP.

 \begin{itemize}
 \item Long (2008) \textit{The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Any changes to a file that has been posted/shared needs a new name.
 	\item Use version commands to ensure others get same results.
  \end{itemize}
 \item Literate programming (extensive commenting, making the aim of code reading by a human)
 \item R Markdown, integration of analysis and output.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Data Sharing}
\begin{frame}{Data Sharing}
Post your code and your data in a trusted public repository.
\begin{itemize}[<.->]
\item
Find the appropriate repository: \url{http://www.re3data.org/}
\item
Repository will last longer than your own website.
\item
